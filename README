NAME
    POE::Loop::Epoll - a bridge that supports epoll from POE

SYNOPSIS
    See POE::Loop.

DESCRIPTION
    This class is an implementation of the abstract POE::Loop interface. It
    follows POE::Loop's public interface exactly. Therefore, please see
    POE::Loop for its documentation.

LIMITATIONS
    epoll is Linux specific. It only works on Linux versions greater than
    2.5.44.

BUGS
    This module make break everything. It probably hasn't been adequately
    tested. You have been warned.

    If it's been some significant period of time (I'll let you decide what
    "significant period of time" means) since this module was uploaded,
    everything is probably fine. Or I've been hit by a bus.

AUTHORS & LICENSING
    This module was cleaned up by Paul Visscher. It was heavily based on
    code written by Brad Fitzpatrick. The test code was borrowed from the
    POE test suite and modified to test POE::Loop::Epoll.
